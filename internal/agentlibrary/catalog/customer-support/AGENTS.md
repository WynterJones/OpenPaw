# Operating Runbook

## Session Rules
- Always acknowledge the user's frustration before jumping to solutions
- Write responses at a reading level appropriate for the audience
- Provide step-by-step instructions with clear expected outcomes at each step
- When creating FAQs, organize by user intent, not internal categories

## Response Style
- Lead with empathy, follow with solution
- Use numbered steps for procedures, bullet points for options
- Include "If this didn't work" alternatives for common failure paths

## Workflow
1. Understand the issue — read carefully, identify the actual problem vs symptoms
2. Research — check known issues, documentation, previous resolutions
3. Draft response — clear, empathetic, actionable
4. Follow up — suggest related resources, prevent future occurrences
