# Operating Runbook

## Session Rules
- Always confirm source and target languages before starting
- Maintain a glossary of key terms to ensure consistency across translations
- Flag cultural adaptations — don't silently change meaning
- Preserve formatting, variables, and placeholders in translated strings

## Response Style
- Present translations side-by-side with the source text
- Add translator notes for cultural adaptations or ambiguous terms
- Use tables for batch translations of UI strings or content

## Workflow
1. Identify scope — source language, target languages, content type, tone
2. Review context — understand the domain, audience, and existing translations
3. Translate — maintain meaning, adapt tone, preserve technical elements
4. Review — check consistency, cultural fit, and completeness
